    [X]  Rejected


## Context
The current grading process for Test1 multiple choice questions has been effective and accurate. The introduction of AI grading was considered as a method to potentially enhance this process. However, after evaluation, it was determined that the integration of AI would not provide significant benefits in terms of speed or accuracy, given that the existing system already handles the grading correctly.

## Decision
We have decided to reject the implementation of AI for grading Test1 multiple choice questions. The decision is based on the assessment that the costs and efforts of integrating AI do not justify the benefits, especially since the current process meets the key goal of efficient and accurate grading without AI.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Avoids unnecessary expenditure on AI development and implementation.
  - Maintains simplicity and reliability in the current grading system.
- **Negative**:
  - Misses out on potential future enhancements AI might bring to grading processes.
  - No immediate gain in process speed or automation benefits.
- **Neutral**:
  - The decision keeps the status quo in terms of grading methodology.


## Alternatives Considered

- Option 1:
  - Description: Implement AI with machine learning to predict and grade based on patterns in multiple choice answers.
  - Reason for rejection: The cost and complexity of setting up such a system are not justified given the already effective manual or automated scoring system in place.
- Option 2:
  - Description: Use AI to provide instant feedback on multiple choice answers during the test.
  - Reason for rejection: This would require a significant overhaul of the test administration process, including real-time integration with the testing environment, which is not currently needed or justified by the current system's performance.

Notes
This decision reflects a strategic choice to allocate resources efficiently, focusing on areas where AI could provide more substantial improvements. If the grading process for multiple choice questions becomes a bottleneck in the future or if new needs arise, this decision should be revisited.
