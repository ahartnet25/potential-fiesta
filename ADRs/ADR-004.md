## Context
Test2 submissions are more complex than those of Test1, consisting of diagrams, images, and longer text responses. This complexity increases the difficulty of automated grading. Like Test1, we've established an N% certainty threshold for AI grading to ensure accuracy, although this threshold might differ from Test1's due to the nature of Test2 submissions. The potential for AI hallucinations remains, hence the need for a robust dispute system where answers can be manually reviewed by the software architect.

## Decision
We have decided to implement an AI grading system for Test2 submissions, complemented by a dispute system for manual review. This decision accounts for the unique challenges presented by diagram and image submissions while maintaining a high standard of grading accuracy through AI with human oversight.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Ensures a high standard of grading even with complex submissions.
  - Enhances customer satisfaction by providing an avenue to correct potential AI misjudgments.
  - Allows for adaptive grading thresholds tailored to different test formats.
- **Negative**:
  - Increased complexity in the AI model to handle diagrams and images might lead to higher computational costs.
  - Manual review increases the workload on the software architect, potentially slowing down the grading process.
  - Risk of inconsistency between AI and human grading criteria.
  - Indecipherable or Poor Quality Images/Handwriting
- **Neutral**:
  - The need for potentially different N% thresholds might require additional configuration and testing.


## Alternatives Considered

- Option 1:
  - Description: Exclusive manual grading for all Test2 submissions.
  - Reason for rejection: This would be highly resource-intensive and might not scale well with increasing test submissions.
- Option 2:
  - Description: Using a simpler AI model without the need for a dispute system.
  - Reason for rejection: This approach would likely increase errors in grading due to the complexity of Test2 submissions, negatively impacting reliability and user trust.

## Notes
The N% certainty threshold for Test2 might need to be adjusted lower or higher than Test1 based on empirical testing with actual submissions to balance accuracy with efficiency. Continuous monitoring and feedback will be essential to fine-tune the AI's performance on these more complex test formats.
