# ADR-002: Use of AI for Enhancing Test1 Analysis
Authored by: The Northstars

## Status

    [X] Proposed
    []  Accepted
    []  Rejected


## Context
Currently, the analysis of Test1 results and the maintenance of the tests are manually performed by the Software Architect. This process is time-consuming, potentially leading to delays in insights and updates to the test structure. The primary issues we aim to solve are the inefficiency of manual data analysis, the need for more robust analysis, and the desire to free up the Software Architect's time for tasks that require human judgment.

## Decision
We have decided to implement AI to enhance the analysis of Test1 results. AI will be used to process data more quickly and robustly than manual methods, providing the Software Architect with more time to focus on tasks that still require human intervention, such as nuanced test modifications and strategic planning.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Increased Efficiency: AI can analyze large datasets much faster than a human, leading to quicker insights.
  - Improved Analysis Quality: AI can detect patterns and correlations in data that might be overlooked by manual analysis, offering more comprehensive insights.
  - Time Savings for Software Architect: More time for strategic tasks, enhancing the overall quality of test maintenance and revisions.
- **Negative**:
  - Initial Setup Costs: There will be costs associated with implementing and training AI systems.
  - Dependency on AI: There's a risk of over-reliance on AI, potentially diminishing skills in manual data analysis.
  - Potential for Misinterpretation: AI might misinterpret certain nuances that require human context, necessitating a review process.
- **Neutral**:
  - Data Management: The need for accurate data input and maintenance to ensure AI results are reliable.


## Alternatives Considered

- **Option 1**:
  - Description: Continue with current manual analysis by the Software Architect.
  - Reason for rejection: Manual analysis is too slow for current needs and may miss subtle trends or insights in the data.
- **Option 2**:
  - Description: Hire additional staff to handle data analysis.
  - Reason for rejection: This would increase operational costs and still might not match the speed and consistency of AI analysis.

## Notes
The implementation of AI for analysis should include regular checks to ensure the accuracy of AI-driven insights.
The Software Architect will still have a role in interpreting AI findings to ensure they align with educational goals and strategies.
