## Context
The introduction of an AI system for grading Test1 answers has been implemented with an N% certainty threshold to ensure high-quality grading. However, there's still a possibility of AI hallucinations or misinterpretations. To address potential inaccuracies and maintain trust in the grading process, we've decided to implement a dispute system where test takers can challenge the AI's grading, leading to a manual review by the software architect.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a dispute system for AI-graded answers. When a grade is disputed, the answer will be sent for manual review by the software architect, who will reassess the answer and potentially adjust the grade.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Ensures a high standard of grading through human oversight.
  - Increases customer satisfaction by providing a mechanism to correct potential AI errors.
  - Provides extra data to enhance RAG
- **Negative**:
  - Increases workload for the software architect, possibly slowing down the grading process.
  - Candidates might over use
- **Neutral**:
        The process adds an extra layer of complexity to the grading system.


## Alternatives Considered

- **Option 1**:
        Description: Use a peer review system where other test takers can review and grade disputed answers.
        Reason for rejection: Potential for bias and inconsistency among peers, and could lead to privacy concerns.
- **Option 2**:
        Description: Implement a machine learning model to self-correct based on disputes without human intervention.
        Reason for rejection: This would require extensive training data and time, which could delay immediate resolution and might not address all edge cases effectively.

Notes
The N% certainty threshold is crucial for filtering out low-confidence AI decisions, but human oversight remains necessary for edge cases and to maintain integrity in the grading process. Further review of this system's effectiveness should be conducted to ensure it meets our quality and speed requirements.
